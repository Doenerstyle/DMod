# D-Mod

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makamys/DMod/master/docs/dmod_banner.png)

D-Mod is a mod that backports some features from later versions of Minecraft to 1.7.10. You could consider it an add-on to [Et Futurum Requiem](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/et-futurum-requiem) (though it's not a hard dependency).

Currently implemented:

* Foxes
* Bundles

## Foxes

Foxes have some (optional) extra features implemented. Untamed, they behave the same as they do in new vanilla versions. But as they defeat enemies, they gain EXP and unlock various new abilities and AI improvements.

The major ones are getting healed when fed food, following the owner after being fed a sweet berry, and possessing Looting I intrinsically (does not stack with swords that have Looting). Foxes pass down their EXP to their children.

More info [in the wiki](https://github.com/makamys/DMod/wiki/Fox).

# Dependencies

* Item icons in bundle tooltips will only be drawn if [NEI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notenoughitems) is installed (I recommend the [GTNH fork](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notenoughitems-gtnh)).
* [Et Futurum Requiem](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/et-futurum-requiem) is highly recommended as it backports sweet berries (useful for foxes) and rabbits (useful for bundles).

# Incompatibilities

* [Hodgepodge](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/Hodgepodge): set `preventPickupLoot=false` or else foxes won't be able to pick up items
* Various coremods will crash during startup due to an incompatibility with Mixin. For example, [Backlytra](https://github.com/unascribed/Backlytra) crashes if D-Mod's `lootingFoxFix` is enabled. This is fixed by [Mixingasm](https://github.com/makamys/Mixingasm).

### About `nomixin` builds

The mod comes in two flavors:
* The regular version embeds Mixin 0.7.11, allowing the mod to run standalone. However, this makes the jar a bit larger, and can cause problems in certain use cases.
* The version marked with `+nomixin` doesn't embed Mixin, which lets it avoid these problems. But it requires a separate [Mixin bootstrap mod](https://gist.github.com/makamys/7cb74cd71d93a4332d2891db2624e17c#mixin-bootstrap-mods) to be installed in order to run. If you have one installed already, getting this version is recommended.
